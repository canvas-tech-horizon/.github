## ✨ Mission

We build small, sharp, and well-documented tools that make developers’ lives easier. Our focus is on DX (developer experience), clear APIs, and real-world practicality over hype.

## 🧰 Current Projects

* **World-Date** (TypeScript) — friendly date/time utilities for formatting, durations, and time zones.

  * Repo: `https://github.com/canvas-tech-horizon/world-date`
  * Status: active • seeking feedback on parsing & time-zone edge cases
* **Notelink** (Go + Fiber) — generate interactive API docs straight from code with examples and auth flows.

  * Repo: `https://github.com/canvas-tech-horizon/notelink`
  * Status: active • polishing examples & DX
  * Url: `https://notelink.dev/`

> Using our tools? ⭐️ a repo and open an issue or discussion — real-world input shapes our roadmap.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Highlights

* World-Date: ISO week-of-year improvements, parsing upgrades, DST/leap-second edge cases, smaller tree-shakeable builds.
* Notelink: richer request/response examples, JWT/Session auth flows, smoother integrations.
